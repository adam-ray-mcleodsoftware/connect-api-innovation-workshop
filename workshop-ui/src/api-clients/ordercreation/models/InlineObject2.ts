/**
 * Order Creation
 * This API requires the use of CustomerFusion. By leveraging CustomerFusion, this API can efficiently post order creations directly to your LoadMaster or PowerBroker Transportation Management System (TMS). CustomerFusion acts as a bridge, ensuring that the data is accurately transmitted and received, thus enabling a smooth and automated order creation process.    ### Getting started   If you want to try out the API now, try our sandbox by filling out the following information:  |Header|Value|  |------|-----|  |Authorization (Auth/Token)|[Get quick access token here](https://controlhub.mcleodsoftware.com/?action=Sandbox)  |customerId|1CHC|  |X-Api-Key|[Get a trial key here](https://innovationhub.mcleodsoftware.com/apis)  |X-Mcld-Tenant|2|  |X-Datafusion-Profile|(blank)|    ### Tips  Change the BOL and Consignee Reference Numbers between Order Requests to make each more unique. While we have a request ID to identify an order request, many companies identify order by Consignee Reference Number or Bill Of Lading Number.    Here is a list of [additional reference numbers and qualifier codes](https://mcleod.stoplight.io/studio/innovation-hub?source=odyxp2qi).  ### Set UP:  The below fields in the contract may be populated with either the LoadMaster/PowerBroker master file values or the partner value.  ##### Fields:  - Locations  - Bill-tos (customer ID)  - Commodities  - Trailer Types  - Charges  - Revenue codes  - Order Type  - Allocation Code  #### Master File Values:  If using master file values, the customer should provide the vendor with the LoadMaster/PowerBroker values.  #### Partner Values:  If using partner values, the customer should add the cross reference to the Order Create profile within LoadMaster/PowerBroker. The vendor should provide unique partner value codes. For example, if multiple customers have the same values for a location, the customer could be concatenated in front of the value when sending in the data, to ensure uniqueness.  - ABC-Grocery-LOC123  - XYZ-Grocery-LOC123  ### PROCESSING:  These fields in the contract are required for order creation. If these are not provided, the data will still load into LoadMaster/PowerBroker, but will require manual updates to complete order creation.  - collectionMethod    - location: under Rating  - customerID   - passed in the API call path parameter  If the customer ID being passed in the API call is not found within the LoadMaster/PowerBroker master file or as a cross reference on the tender profile, the tender will create, but the LoadMaster/PowerBroker user will need to follow these steps to finish order creation:  - Set up the bill-to in LoadMaster/PowerBroker.  - Manually add the bill-to when creating the order from the tender.  - Add the cross reference to the tender profile, for future processing.    Some LoadMaster/PowerBroker customers may be set to not require a bill-to for order creation, allowing the tender and order to create automatically, even if no matching bill-to is present.    Customers may have other internal settings that could prevent auto-creation of the order, such as allocation, modifications, etc.    If seconds and milliseconds are provided in the time, the API does not process those and therefore those values will not be returned in the time.    There are two scenarios for handling time zones:     First, for a stop, the timezone offet is expected to be correct. We will convert the offset to GMT and apply that time to the correct time zone of the city. So if your offset is incorrect, you may be returned a different time than you sent in.     Second, for not stop times, we will convert the offset to GMT and apply the correct time and offset to the customers server time.   The time returned will be in the offset of customer\'s server.    ### Overview  This endpoint provides a comprehensive solution capable of creating orders within the Transportation Management System (TMS). It empowers users, including software vendors, to develop AI-driven systems that can read emails and other unstructured data, ultimately leading to the automatic creation of orders. This endpoint efficiently processes incoming messages and can automatically accept tenders, thus streamlining the order placement process.
